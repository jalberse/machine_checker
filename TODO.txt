### TODO

- Make a trello board
- Unit tests for machine construction
- Construct DFA from file
	- Define input file format
	- New DFA constructor
	- Let user define the input file as an optional 
parameter
- Run against a batch of examples/counter-examples to determine correctness
	- User classification of examples
	- Batch == store examples/read from file, I think
- Equivalence testing with RegEx
- Equivalence testing with other DFAs
- Graphical interface
- Context free grammars and deterministic pushdown automata?
