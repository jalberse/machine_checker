### TODO

- Make a trello board
- Additional Unit tests for machine 
construction
- DFA removal methods need before continuing GUI
- GUI
	- Finish interaction with DFA
		- Edit transitions functionality
	- Ensure models don't allow invalid transitions to be input, 
etc...
	- Word input to test machine
		- Batch eventually
	- Graphical display, not just 
text
	- Load a DFA file in an update 
accordingly
- Run against a batch of examples/counter-examples to determine correctness
	- User classification of examples
	- Batch == store examples/read from file, I think
- Equivalence testing with RegEx
- Equivalence testing with other DFAs
- Context free grammars and deterministic pushdown automata?
